I was attracted by the mysteries of the universe long time ago. I remember when I was in primary school, the teacher asked us, what is your dream? At that time, being a scientist probably means being poor. We however, admire scientists a lot. Most of my classmates said they want to be a scientist. I would like to be a scientist as well. I also said I want to be an astronomer as a detailed direction. After about 20 years, I got the Ph.D degree in physics and studied in cosmology. I guess I have fulfilled my dream in the childhood.
