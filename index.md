# Jiajun Zhang (张佳骏)

I am currently an associate professor (副研究员) at Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

From 2019 to 2021, I was a Postoc in CTPU IBS, Korea. From 2017 to 2019, I was a Postdoc in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://astro.sjtu.edu.cn/DaoLeft.aspx?navid=31&hassons=0&selfurl=0&fathernav=4), in collaborate with [Prof. Jun Zhang](http://astro.sjtu.edu.cn/DaoLeft.aspx?navid=31&hassons=0&selfurl=0&fathernav=4). My research focus on cosmology, large scale structure, dark matter and dark energy and N-body simulation. I am very familiar with N-body simulation code Gadget2 and several useful modification was made. I got my Ph.D in The Chinese University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Prof. Ming-Chung Chu](http://www.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/people/chu.html).

My recent research is about building up proper tools for testing cosmological models beyond LCDM, i.e. Fuzzy Dark Matter, Interacting Dark Energy, Interacting Vacuum Energy, Modified Gravity, and more. Beyond that, I am working for [BINGO project](https://www.bingotelescope.org), leading stage III working group. I am now in the SKA group in SHAO, studying Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn.

I am now living in Shanghai, China
